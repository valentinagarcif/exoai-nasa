📈 Scientific Impact & NASA Relevance
💰 Telescope Resource Optimization
python
# Economic Impact Calculation
telescope_time_cost = 1250  # $/minute for space telescopes
false_positive_rate = 0.492  # Original NASA data
our_precision = 0.893  # EXO-AI performance

savings_per_detection = (false_positive_rate * our_precision) * telescope_time_cost
# Result: $549 saved per exoplanet detection 🚀
🎯 Key Astronomical Discoveries
Our feature importance analysis revealed:

koi_prad (19.9%) - Planetary radius most significant

koi_depth (15.1%) - Transit depth critical for detection

koi_period (11.0%) - Orbital period fundamental for habitability
